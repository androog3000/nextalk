This test project began as the basic counter increment and decrement example for understanding React state. I expanded on it by incorporating use of useEffect by creating an array that stores the value of count each time it changes. This is a simple but good example of using React verses a traditional approach of a global array variable. In this example, the array is created using useState and useEffect allows us to adjust the array whenever count changes by using count in the dependency array.

One more addition is to reset count and the array using a reset button in a parent component but the array is maintained in a child component. This is achieved by sending state through the child component call in the parent. In Counter, the state of count, the state of a boolean indicating whether the reset button has been triggered, and a callback function resetting the boolean to false are all sent to NumberDisplay. The boolean and callback are both included in the dependency array of the useEffect hook in the child component NumberDisplay. The boolean, resetTrigger is the main dependent variable where if it switches to true, count and the array are reset. resetTrigger will switch to false during the useEffect hook when onResetComplete is called, and as it is currently there is nothing needed to handle resetTrigger being false since count and the myNums array have just been reset.
